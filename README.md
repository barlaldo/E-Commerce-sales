The project was conducted by considering the three sectors with the highest availability
of observations. However, the models utilized can also be applied to other branches, thereby
providing a comprehensive overview of the entire e-commerce landscape.
The dataset provided underwent a preparation procedure, ensuring its efficacy and op-
timization in alignment with the projectâ€™s goals. Indeed The predictive models we employed
require a specific type of data modeling to utilize them effectively and generate accurate
forecasts.
Following the data preprocessing, the project shifted its focus towards testing the fol-
lowing predictive models: ARIMA, PROPHET and TBATS. The analysis period selected
encompass the timeframe from January 1st, 2016 to May 12th, 2023, while the forecast
projected values up to December 31st, 2023.
Lastly, the performance of the forecasting models is assested by the computation of
key evaluation metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and MAPE, providing a comprehensive un-
derstanding of how to interpret and compare models with each other effectively.
